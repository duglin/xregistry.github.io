The xRegistry project defines an abstact model for how to manage metadata
about resources and provide a REST-based interface for creating, modifying,
deleting and discovering of those resources. The project includes a "core"
specification that defines the basic model and APIs of a Registry and a
set of domain specific specifications that extend that core for particular
use cases. By leveraging the same "core" model/APIs, generic tooling and
comon patterns of Registry access can be developed which help create an
interopable (and standard) interface.

See the main [repo](http://github.com/xregistry/spec) for more information.
