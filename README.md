The xRegistry project defines an abstract model for managing metadata about
resources and provides a REST-based interface to discover, create, modify and
delete those resources. The project includes a "core"
specification that defines the basic model and APIs of a Registry and a
set of domain specific specifications that extend that core for particular
use cases. By leveraging the same "core" model/APIs, generic tooling and
comon patterns of Registry access can be developed which help create an
interopable (and standard) interface.
